<h5>Jaya Kunder

    Principal
    
    M.A., B.ED
    
    Dear Parents and Children,
    
    It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of GCC International School and serve as your new Principal. My journey as an educationist started in 2001. Since then, for over 20 years, I have been devoted to nurturing young minds to strengthen their potential through a holistic approach.
    
    I’ve been a teacher, a coordinator and a Principal, however, through all my roles, my aim has always been to ensure a child’s emotional growth along with intellectual
    Intelligence.
    
    At GCC International School, we have a strong participation culture among the management department, our beloved teachers, our backbone – the parents and the administration department. It is this collaboration that fueled the growth of our school; giving our children a set of wings that may carry them far and wide.
    
    GIS-Principal
    We firmly believe our distinction lies in the pursuit of high academic attainment through support, encouragement, praises and motivation. Thus, I invite students from various backgrounds and competencies to become a part of the best school in Mira Road – GCC International School, as a dynamic launching platform to excel in their career.
    
    Let us become equal stakeholders in moulding our children into desirable individuals. Let’s join hands in this rewarding mission of all-round value-based education, keeping in mind – each child matters and each child is unique.</h5>
